    "**Substitution method:** The substitution method involves making a guess about the solution of the recurrence relation and then using mathematical induction to prove its correctness. This method is often used when the recurrence has a clear pattern that can be guessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recursion tree method:** This method involves visualizing the recursive calls of the algorithm as a tree. Each node in the tree represents a subproblem, and the edges represent the recursive calls. Analyzing the work done at each level of the tree and summing up the contributions allows for deriving the overall time complexity.\n",

    "**Master theorem:** The Master theorem is a powerful tool used to solve recurrence relations that follow a specific form known as divide-and-conquer recurrences. It provides formulas that give the asymptotic time complexity directly based on the properties of the recurrence.\n",
