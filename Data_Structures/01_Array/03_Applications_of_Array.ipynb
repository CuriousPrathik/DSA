    "## **1 - Linear Search:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Search is a **basic searching algorithm** that sequentially checks each element of a collection until a match is found or the entire collection has been traversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start from the beginning of the collection.\n",
    "2. Compare the current element with the target element.\n",
    "3. If they match, the search is successful; return the index.\n",
    "4. If not, move to the next element and repeat steps 2-3.\n",
    "5. If the entire collection is traversed without finding the target, return a \"not found\" indicator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have an array of integers: `[3, 6, 1, 9, 5, 2]` and we want to search for the element `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with the first element `3`. Not a match.\n",
    "2. Move to the next element `6`. Not a match.\n",
    "3. Next is `1`. Not a match.\n",
    "4. Next is `9`. Not a match.\n",
    "5. Next is `5`. We found a match! Return the index `4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages and Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Search is simple to understand and implement. \n",
    "\n",
    "It works well for small collections or when the element being searched for is likely to be at the beginning of the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Disadvantages:** \n",
    "\n",
    "For large collections, Linear Search can be slow because it requires checking each element one by one. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexities** for various scenarios in Linear Search:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Best Case:** The best-case scenario occurs when the target element is found in the first comparison, O(1) time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Worst Case:** The worst-case scenario happens when the target element is found at the last position of the collection or is not present at all. For a collection with 'n' elements, time complexity of O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Average Case:** The average-case scenario assumes that the element being searched for could be located anywhere in the collection with equal probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "On average, Linear Search would need to make about 'n/2' comparisons for a collection of 'n' elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "This results in an average-case time complexity of O(n/2), which simplifies to O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "- Best Case Time Complexity: O(1)\n",
    "- Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n)\n",
    "- Average Case Time Complexity: O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexities** for Linear Search:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Search doesn't need extra memory to work. \n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of space it uses doesn't change after the array if defined. This makes Linear Search efficient in terms of memory usage."

    "## **2 - Binary Search:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Search is an efficient searching algorithm that works on sorted collections (like sorted arrays). \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of searching through elements one by one, Binary Search continually divides the search range in half until it finds the target element or determines that it's not present.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like a smart \"divide and conquer\" approach that reduces the search space with each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:** Start with a sorted collection (array) and the target element you want to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Search Range Definition:** Define indexs: `i` at the start of the collection and `j` at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Midpoint Calculation:** \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common formulas to calculate the midpoint value when implementing Binary Search:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple Average:** `(i + j) / 2` - it might lead to integer overflow issues, especially when working with large values of `i` and `j`.\n",
    "2. **Bitwise Shift:** `i + (j - i) / 2` - The division by 2 is effectively a right-shift operation, which is more efficient than regular division. This formula avoids integer overflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Both formulas yield the same result in most cases, but the second formula using a bitwise shift is more efficient and can avoid integer overflow issues in some programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comparison:** Compare the element at the `mid` index with the target element.\n",
    "   - If they match, you've found the target. The search is successful.\n",
    "   - If the target is smaller, narrow the search range to the left half (set `j = mid - 1`).\n",
    "   - If the target is larger, narrow the search range to the right half (set `i = mid + 1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Repeat:** Continue steps 3-4 until you find the target or the search range becomes empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Binary Search is very efficient. With each step, the search range is halved.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even with a large collection, Binary Search can find the target in just a few steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- It only works with sorted data. If the collection isn't sorted, you need to sort it first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly, let's break down all the complexities associated with Binary Search:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Case:**\n",
    "- The best case occurs when the target element is found at the very first comparison.\n",
    "- In this case, the time complexity is O(1), which means it's very fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Worst Case:**\n",
    "- The worst case occurs when the target element is at the farthest possible position in the array or is not present at all.\n",
    "- In each step, you halve the search space, but you'll need to do this log₂(n) times, where n is the number of elements.\n",
    "- Therefore, the worst-case time complexity of Binary Search is O(log n), where log is the logarithm base 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Average Case:**\n",
    "- The average-case time complexity of Binary Search is also O(log n).\n",
    "- It's expected that you'll need to perform log₂(n) comparisons on average to find the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Binary Search uses a few variables like `low`, `high`, and `mid` to keep track of the search range and current position.\n",
    "- These variables require constant space, regardless of the size of the input array.\n",
    "- Binary Search uses a constant amount of memory, making its space complexity O(1), which is also known as \"constant space.\"\n"
